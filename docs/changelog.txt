1.10  2009.07.11
---------------------------------------
Fixes:
* Admin: Corrected output since there is nothing to set.
* Module: Fixed an error in XML processing which didn't properly truncate output.  This fixed an IE rendering issue.

Adds:
* Module: XML output caching and configuration of cache timeout.  (From UHQ_Radio 0.03)

Notes:
* This module for all intents and purposes is feature-complete.  Short of a bug-fix release, no new features are on the board to be added.

---------------------------------------
1.02  2008.09.27
---------------------------------------
Fixes:
* Blocks: A few more default values were off.  Hopefully, these are all corrected.

==[ version 1.01 ]====[ 2008.09.05 ]==

Fixes:
* Blocks: Fixed output in conditions where there is no <artist> in IceCast XML, and no " - " in the title to split with.  Now, title-only output is assumed w/o a delimiter.
* Blocks: Default values are now set properly.

Changes:
* Blocks: Option to supress offline error messages.  This can always be turned on for troubleshooting.
* Rename module to uhq_radiobasic.  Uninstall any older release before installing this one.
* Update module logo for XOOPS 2.3.

==[ version 1.00 RC ]====[ 2008.08.18 ]==

* Process combined titles to split out artist/song by first instance of " - ".
* Tune-In links, with targets to _top, _blank, or a pop-up of specified size.

Changes:

* Grab XML files w/ a function instead.  Code is better, and we'll need it later.
* Extract XML elements w/ a function, based on start / end tags.
* Support combined titles for Ogg streams.

==[ version 0.01 ]====[ 2008.08.10 ]==
